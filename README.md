# Personal-Data-Input-Form
The Personal Data Input Form is a Python program designed to collect, validate, and store user information in a structured format. It provides a simple yet effective interface for entering personal details such as name, age, email, phone number, and address. The project demonstrates how Python can be used to build interactive forms with input validation and optional data persistence.

🔹 Features
🖊️ User-Friendly Input Prompts – Guides users step by step to enter personal details.
✅ Validation Checks – Ensures data integrity (e.g., valid email format, numeric age, phone number length).
💾 Data Storage Options – Saves collected data into text/CSV files or displays it directly in the console.
🔄 Error Handling – Prevents crashes by handling invalid inputs gracefully.
🔍 Extensible Design – Easy to expand with additional fields or integrate into larger applications.

🔹 Tech Stack
Language: Python 3.x
Libraries Used:
re (for regex-based validation)
csv or json (for data storage, optional)
os (for file handling, optional)

🔹 Example Workflow
Program prompts the user for personal details.
Each input is validated before acceptance.
Data is displayed back to the user for confirmation.
Optionally, the data is saved into a file for later use.

🔹 Use Cases
📋 Collecting user information for registration systems

🗂️ Building prototypes of data entry application
